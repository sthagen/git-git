<pattern>...::
	If one or more patterns are given, only refs are shown that
	match against at least one pattern, either using fnmatch(3) or
	literally, in the latter case matching completely or from the
	beginning up to a slash.

--stdin::
	If `--stdin` is supplied, then the list of patterns is read from
	standard input instead of from the argument list.

--count=<count>::
	By default the command shows all refs that match
	`<pattern>`.  This option makes it stop after showing
	that many refs.

--sort=<key>::
	A field name to sort on.  Prefix `-` to sort in
	descending order of the value.  When unspecified,
	`refname` is used.  You may use the --sort=<key> option
	multiple times, in which case the last key becomes the primary
	key.

--format=<format>::
	A string that interpolates `%(fieldname)` from a ref being shown and
	the object it points at. In addition, the string literal `%%`
	renders as `%` and `%xx` - where `xx` are hex digits - renders as
	the character with hex code `xx`. For example, `%00` interpolates to
	`\0` (NUL), `%09` to `\t` (TAB), and `%0a` to `\n` (LF).
+
When unspecified, `<format>` defaults to `%(objectname) SPC %(objecttype)
TAB %(refname)`.

--color[=<when>]::
	Respect any colors specified in the `--format` option. The
	`<when>` field must be one of `always`, `never`, or `auto` (if
	`<when>` is absent, behave as if `always` was given).

--shell::
--perl::
--python::
--tcl::
	If given, strings that substitute `%(fieldname)`
	placeholders are quoted as string literals suitable for
	the specified host language.  This is meant to produce
	a scriptlet that can directly be `eval`ed.

--points-at=<object>::
	Only list refs which points at the given object.

--merged[=<object>]::
	Only list refs whose tips are reachable from the
	specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

--no-merged[=<object>]::
	Only list refs whose tips are not reachable from the
	specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

--contains[=<object>]::
	Only list refs which contain the specified commit (HEAD if not
	specified).

--no-contains[=<object>]::
	Only list refs which don't contain the specified commit (HEAD
	if not specified).

--ignore-case::
	Sorting and filtering refs are case insensitive.

--omit-empty::
	Do not print a newline after formatted refs where the format expands
	to the empty string.

--exclude=<pattern>::
	If one or more patterns are given, only refs which do not match
	any excluded pattern(s) are shown. Matching is done using the
	same rules as `<pattern>` above.

--include-root-refs::
	List root refs (HEAD and pseudorefs) apart from regular refs.

--start-after=<marker>::
    Allows paginating the output by skipping references up to and including the
    specified marker. When paging, it should be noted that references may be
    deleted, modified or added between invocations. Output will only yield those
    references which follow the marker lexicographically. Output begins from the
    first reference that would come after the marker alphabetically. Cannot be
    used with `--sort=<key>` or `--stdin` options, or the _<pattern>_ argument(s)
    to limit the refs.
