Git v2.38 Release Notes
=======================

Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Collection of what is referenced by objects in promisor packs have
   been optimized to inspect these objects in the in-pack order.
   (merge 18c08abc82 jk/optim-promisor-object-enumeration later to maint).

 * Introduce a helper to see if a branch is already being worked on
   (hence should not be newly checked out in a working tree), which
   performs much better than the existing find_shared_symref() to
   replace many uses of the latter.

 * Teach "git archive" to (optionally and then by default) avoid
   spawning an external "gzip" process when creating ".tar.gz" (and
   ".tgz") archives.
   (merge 4f4be00d30 rs/archive-with-internal-gzip later to maint).


Fixes since v2.37
-----------------

 * Rewrite of "git add -i" in C that appeared in Git 2.25 didn't
   correctly record a removed file to the index, which was fixed.
   (merge 4788e8b256 js/add-i-delete later to maint).

 * Certain diff options are currently ignored when combined-diff is
   shown; mark them as incompatible with the feature.
   (merge cfb19ae05f rs/combine-diff-with-incompatible-options later to maint).

 * Adjust technical/bitmap-format to be formatted by AsciiDoc, and
   add some missing information to the documentation.
   (merge ac7667bd44 ac/bitmap-format-doc later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 5fd9d1738e jk/revisions-doc-markup-fix later to maint).
