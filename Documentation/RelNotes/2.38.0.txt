Git v2.38 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git remote show [-n] frotz" now pays attention to negative
   pathspec.

 * "git push" sometimes perform poorly when reachability bitmaps are
   used, even in a repository where other operations are helped by
   bitmaps.  The push.useBitmaps configuration variable is introduced
   to allow disabling use of reachability bitmaps only for "git push".

 * "git grep -m<max-hits>" is a way to limit the hits shown per file.

 * "git merge-tree" learned a new mode where it takes two commits and
   computes a tree that would result in the merge commit, if the
   histories leading to these two commits were to be merged.

 * "git mv A B" in a sparsely populated working tree can be asked to
   move a path between directories that are "in cone" (i.e. expected
   to be materialized in the working tree) and "out of cone"
   (i.e. expected to be hidden).  The handling of such cases has been
   improved.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Collection of what is referenced by objects in promisor packs have
   been optimized to inspect these objects in the in-pack order.

 * Introduce a helper to see if a branch is already being worked on
   (hence should not be newly checked out in a working tree), which
   performs much better than the existing find_shared_symref() to
   replace many uses of the latter.

 * Teach "git archive" to (optionally and then by default) avoid
   spawning an external "gzip" process when creating ".tar.gz" (and
   ".tgz") archives.

 * Allow large objects read from a packstream to be streamed into a
   loose object file straight, without having to keep it in-core as a
   whole.

 * Further preparation to turn git-submodule.sh into a builtin
   continues.


Fixes since v2.37
-----------------

 * Rewrite of "git add -i" in C that appeared in Git 2.25 didn't
   correctly record a removed file to the index, which was fixed.
   (merge 4788e8b256 js/add-i-delete later to maint).

 * Certain diff options are currently ignored when combined-diff is
   shown; mark them as incompatible with the feature.
   (merge cfb19ae05f rs/combine-diff-with-incompatible-options later to maint).

 * Adjust technical/bitmap-format to be formatted by AsciiDoc, and
   add some missing information to the documentation.
   (merge ac7667bd44 ac/bitmap-format-doc later to maint).

 * Fixes for tests when the source directory has unusual characters in
   its path, e.g. whitespaces, double-quotes, etc.
   (merge eb1cd60290 ab/test-quoting-fix later to maint).

 * "git mktree --missing" lazily fetched objects that are missing from
   the local object store, which was totally unnecessary for the purpose
   of creating the tree object(s) from its input.
   (merge 817b0f6027 ro/mktree-allow-missing-fix later to maint).

 * Give _() markings to fatal/warning/usage: labels that are shown in
   front of these messages.
   (merge a1fd2cf8cd dr/i18n-die-warn-error-usage later to maint).

 * References to commands-to-be-typed-literally in "git rebase"
   documentation mark-up have been corrected.
   (merge 54e51e559e ds/git-rebase-doc-markup later to maint).

 * In a non-bare repository, the behavior of Git when the
   core.worktree configuration variable points at a directory that has
   a repository as its subdirectory, regressed in Git 2.27 days.
   (merge d6c9a71755 gg/worktree-from-the-above later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 5fd9d1738e jk/revisions-doc-markup-fix later to maint).
   (merge 1971510c35 pb/diff-doc-raw-format later to maint).
