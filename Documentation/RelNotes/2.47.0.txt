Git v2.47 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Many Porcelain commands that internally use the merge machinery
   were taught to consistently honor the diff.algorithm configuration.

 * A few descriptions in "git show-ref -h" have been clarified.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * A build tweak knob has been simplified by not setting the value
   that is already the default; another unused one has been removed.

 * A CI job that use clang-format to check coding style issues in new
   code has been added.

 * The reviewing guidelines document now explicitly encourages people
   to give positive reviews and how.


Fixes since v2.46
-----------------

 * "git add -p" by users with diff.suppressBlankEmpty set to true
   failed to parse the patch that represents an unmodified empty line
   with an empty line (not a line with a single space on it), which
   has been corrected.
   (merge 60cf761ed1 pw/add-patch-with-suppress-blank-empty later to maint).

 * "git checkout --ours" (no other arguments) complained that the
   option is incompatible with branch switching, which is technically
   correct, but found confusing by some users.  It now says that the
   user needs to give pathspec to specify what paths to checkout.
   (merge d1e6c61272 jc/checkout-no-op-switch-errors later to maint).

 * It has been documented that we avoid "VAR=VAL shell_func" and why.
   (merge 728a1962cd jc/doc-one-shot-export-with-shell-func later to maint).

 * "git rebase --help" referred to "offset" (the difference between
   the location a change was taken from and the change gets replaced)
   incorrectly and called it "fuzz", which has been corrected.
   (merge 70058db385 jc/doc-rebase-fuzz-vs-offset-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 8db8786fc2 jt/doc-post-receive-hook-update later to maint).
   (merge 1c473dd6af tn/doc-commit-fix later to maint).
   (merge bb0498b1bb jc/how-to-maintain-updates later to maint).
