Git v2.47 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Many Porcelain commands that internally use the merge machinery
   were taught to consistently honor the diff.algorithm configuration.

 * A few descriptions in "git show-ref -h" have been clarified.

 * A 'P' command to "git add -p" that passes the patch hunk to the
   pager has been added.

 * "git grep -W" omits blank lines that follow the found function at
   the end of the file, just like it omits blank lines before the next
   function.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * A build tweak knob has been simplified by not setting the value
   that is already the default; another unused one has been removed.

 * A CI job that use clang-format to check coding style issues in new
   code has been added.

 * The reviewing guidelines document now explicitly encourages people
   to give positive reviews and how.

 * Test script linter has been updated to catch an attempt to use
   one-shot export construct "VAR=VAL func" for shell functions (which
   does not work for some shells) better.

 * Some project conventions have been added to CodingGuidelines.


Fixes since v2.46
-----------------

 * "git add -p" by users with diff.suppressBlankEmpty set to true
   failed to parse the patch that represents an unmodified empty line
   with an empty line (not a line with a single space on it), which
   has been corrected.
   (merge 60cf761ed1 pw/add-patch-with-suppress-blank-empty later to maint).

 * "git checkout --ours" (no other arguments) complained that the
   option is incompatible with branch switching, which is technically
   correct, but found confusing by some users.  It now says that the
   user needs to give pathspec to specify what paths to checkout.
   (merge d1e6c61272 jc/checkout-no-op-switch-errors later to maint).

 * It has been documented that we avoid "VAR=VAL shell_func" and why.
   (merge 728a1962cd jc/doc-one-shot-export-with-shell-func later to maint).

 * "git rebase --help" referred to "offset" (the difference between
   the location a change was taken from and the change gets replaced)
   incorrectly and called it "fuzz", which has been corrected.
   (merge 70058db385 jc/doc-rebase-fuzz-vs-offset-fix later to maint).

 * "git notes add -m '' --allow-empty" and friends that take prepared
   data to create notes should not invoke an editor, but it started
   doing so since Git 2.42, which has been corrected.
   (merge 8b426c84f3 dd/notes-empty-no-edit-by-default later to maint).

 * An expensive operation to prepare tracing was done in re-encoding
   code path even when the tracing was not requested, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 63ad8dbf16 dh/encoding-trace-optim later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 8db8786fc2 jt/doc-post-receive-hook-update later to maint).
   (merge 1c473dd6af tn/doc-commit-fix later to maint).
   (merge bb0498b1bb jc/how-to-maintain-updates later to maint).
   (merge 6e71d6ac7c ks/unit-test-comment-typofix later to maint).
   (merge 63ee933383 ps/p4-tests-updates later to maint).
