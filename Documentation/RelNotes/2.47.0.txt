Git v2.47 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Many Porcelain commands that internally use the merge machinery
   were taught to consistently honor the diff.algorithm configuration.

 * A few descriptions in "git show-ref -h" have been clarified.

 * A 'P' command to "git add -p" that passes the patch hunk to the
   pager has been added.

 * "git grep -W" omits blank lines that follow the found function at
   the end of the file, just like it omits blank lines before the next
   function.

 * The value of http.proxy can have "path" at the end for a socks
   proxy that listens to a unix-domain socket, but we started to
   discard it when we taught proxy auth code path to use the
   credential helpers, which has been corrected.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * A build tweak knob has been simplified by not setting the value
   that is already the default; another unused one has been removed.

 * A CI job that use clang-format to check coding style issues in new
   code has been added.

 * The reviewing guidelines document now explicitly encourages people
   to give positive reviews and how.

 * Test script linter has been updated to catch an attempt to use
   one-shot export construct "VAR=VAL func" for shell functions (which
   does not work for some shells) better.

 * Some project conventions have been added to CodingGuidelines.

 * In the refs subsystem, implicit reliance of the_repository has been
   eliminated; the repository associated with the ref store object is
   used instead.

 * Various tests in reftable library have been rewritten using the unit test
   framework.

 * A test that fails on an unusually slow machine was found, and made
   less likely to cause trouble by lengthening the expiry value it
   uses.


Fixes since v2.46
-----------------

 * "git add -p" by users with diff.suppressBlankEmpty set to true
   failed to parse the patch that represents an unmodified empty line
   with an empty line (not a line with a single space on it), which
   has been corrected.
   (merge 60cf761ed1 pw/add-patch-with-suppress-blank-empty later to maint).

 * "git checkout --ours" (no other arguments) complained that the
   option is incompatible with branch switching, which is technically
   correct, but found confusing by some users.  It now says that the
   user needs to give pathspec to specify what paths to checkout.
   (merge d1e6c61272 jc/checkout-no-op-switch-errors later to maint).

 * It has been documented that we avoid "VAR=VAL shell_func" and why.
   (merge 728a1962cd jc/doc-one-shot-export-with-shell-func later to maint).

 * "git rebase --help" referred to "offset" (the difference between
   the location a change was taken from and the change gets replaced)
   incorrectly and called it "fuzz", which has been corrected.
   (merge 70058db385 jc/doc-rebase-fuzz-vs-offset-fix later to maint).

 * "git notes add -m '' --allow-empty" and friends that take prepared
   data to create notes should not invoke an editor, but it started
   doing so since Git 2.42, which has been corrected.
   (merge 8b426c84f3 dd/notes-empty-no-edit-by-default later to maint).

 * An expensive operation to prepare tracing was done in re-encoding
   code path even when the tracing was not requested, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 63ad8dbf16 dh/encoding-trace-optim later to maint).

 * More leakfixes.
   (merge f30bfafcd4 ps/leakfixes-part-3 later to maint).

 * The credential helper to talk to OSX keychain sometimes sent
   garbage bytes after the username, which has been corrected.
   (merge b201316835 jk/osxkeychain-username-is-nul-terminated later to maint).

 * A recent update broke "git ls-remote" used outside a repository,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 9e89dcb66a ps/ls-remote-out-of-repo-fix later to maint).

 * The patch parser in 'git apply' has been a bit more lenient against
   unexpected mode bits, like 100664, recorded on extended header lines.
   (merge e95d515141 jk/apply-patch-mode-check-fix later to maint).

 * "git config --value=foo --fixed-value section.key newvalue" barfed
   when the existing value in the configuration file used the
   valueless true syntax, which has been corrected.
   (merge 615d2de3b4 tb/config-fixed-value-with-valueless-true later to maint).

 * The patch parser in "git patch-id" has been tightened to avoid
   getting confused by lines that look like a patch header in the log
   message.
   (merge a6e9429f72 jc/patch-id later to maint).

 * "git reflog expire" failed to honor annotated tags when computing
   reachable commits.
   (merge 5133ead528 jc/reflog-expire-lookup-commit-fix later to maint).

 * A flakey test and incorrect calls to strtoX() functions have been
   fixed.
   (merge ec60bb9fc4 kl/test-fixes later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 8db8786fc2 jt/doc-post-receive-hook-update later to maint).
   (merge 1c473dd6af tn/doc-commit-fix later to maint).
   (merge bb0498b1bb jc/how-to-maintain-updates later to maint).
   (merge 6e71d6ac7c ks/unit-test-comment-typofix later to maint).
