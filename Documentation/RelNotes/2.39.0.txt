Git v2.39 Release Notes
=======================

Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * With a bit of header twiddling, use the native regexp library on
   macOS instead of the compat/ one.

 * Prepare for GNU [ef]grep that throw warning of their uses.

 * Sources related to fuzz testing have been moved down to their own
   directory.


Fixes since v2.38
-----------------

 * The codepath that reads from the index v4 had unaligned memory
   accesses, which has been corrected.
   (merge 4a6ed30f96 vd/fix-unaligned-read-index-v4 later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
