Git v2.48 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * A new configuration variable remote.<name>.serverOption makes the
   transport layer act as if the --serverOption=<value> option is
   given from the command line.

 * "git rebase --rebase-merges" now uses branch names as labels when
   able.

 * Describe the policy to introduce breaking changes.

 * Teach 'git notes add' and 'git notes append' a new '-e' flag,
   instructing them to open the note in $GIT_EDITOR before saving.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * Document "amlog" notes.
   (merge ddfb5bcfc6 tb/notes-amlog-doc later to maint).

 * The way AsciiDoc is used for SYNOPSIS part of the manual pages has
   been revamped.  The sources, at least for the simple cases, got
   vastly pleasant to work with.

 * The reftable library is now prepared to expect that the memory
   allocation function given to it may fail to allocate and to deal
   with such an error.

 * An extra worktree attached to a repository points at each other to
   allow finding the repository from the worktree and vice versa
   possible.  Turn this linkage to relative paths.

 * Enable Windows-based CI in GitLab.

 * Commands that can also work outside Git have learned to take the
   repository instance "repo" when we know we are in a repository, and
   NULL when we are not, in a parameter.  The uses of the_repository
   variable in a few of them have been removed using the new calling
   convention.

 * The reftable sub-system grew a new reftable-specific strbuf
   replacement to reduce its dependency on Git-specific data
   structures.

 * The ref-filter machinery learns to recognize and avoid cases where
   sorting would be redundant.

 * Various platform compatibility fixes split out of the larger effort
   to use Meson as the primary build tool.

 * Treat ECONNABORTED the same as ECONNRESET in 'git credential-cache'
   to work around a possible Cygwin regression. This resolves a race
   condition caused by changes in Cygwin's handling of socket
   closures, allowing the client to exit cleanly when encountering
   ECONNABORTED.

 * Demonstrate an assertion failure in 'git mv'.

 * Documentation update to clarify that 'uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant'
   implies both 'allowTipSHA1InWant' and 'allowReachableSHA1InWant'.

 * Replace various calls to atoi() with strtol_i() and strtoul_ui(),
   and add improved error handling.

 * Documentation updates to 'git-update-ref(1)'.

 * Update the project's CodingGuidelines to discourage naming functions
   with a "_1()" suffix.

 * Updates the '.clang-format' to match project conventions.

 * Centralize documentation for repository extensions into a single place.

 * Buildfix and upgrade of Clar to a newer version.


Fixes since v2.47
-----------------

 * Doc update to clarify how periodical maintenance are scheduled,
   spread across time to avoid thundering hurds.
   (merge 3d6ab4177d sk/doc-maintenance-schedule later to maint).

 * Use after free and double freeing at the end in "git log -L... -p"
   had been identified and fixed.
   (merge fc5589d6c1 ds/line-log-asan-fix later to maint).

 * On macOS, fsmonitor can fall into a race condition that results in
   a client waiting forever to be notified for an event that have
   already happened.  This problem has been corrected.
   (merge 51907f8fee jk/fsmonitor-event-listener-race-fix later to maint).

 * "git maintenance start" crashed due to an uninitialized variable
   reference, which has been corrected.
   (merge c95547a394 ps/maintenance-start-crash-fix later to maint).

 * Fail gracefully instead of crashing when attempting to write the
   contents of a corrupt in-core index as a tree object.
   (merge ecb5c4318c ps/cache-tree-w-broken-index-entry later to maint).

 * A "git fetch" from the superproject going down to a submodule used
   a wrong remote when the default remote names are set differently
   between them.
   (merge 0c1a9987da db/submodule-fetch-with-remote-name-fix later to maint).

 * Fixes compile time warnings with 64-bit MSVC.

 * Teaches 'shortlog' to explicitly use SHA-1 when operating outside
   of a repository.

 * Fix 'git grep' regression on macOS by disabling lookahead when
   encountering invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.

 * The dumb-http code regressed when the result of re-indexing a pack
   yielded an *.idx file that differs in content from the *.idx file
   it downloaded from the remote. This has been corrected by no longer
   relying on: the *.idx file we got from the remote.

 * When called with '--left-right' and '--use-bitmap-index', 'rev-list'
   will produce output without any left/right markers, which has been
   corrected.

 * More leakfixes.

 * Test modernization.

 * The "--shallow-exclude=<ref>" option to various history transfer
   commands takes a ref, not an arbitrary revision.

 * A regression where commit objects missing from a commit-graph can
   cause an infinite loop when doing a fetch in a partial clone has
   been fixed.

 * The MinGW compatibility layer has been taught to support POSIX
   semantics for atomic renames when other process(es) have a file
   opened at the destination path.

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
