Git v2.41 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Allow information carried on the WWW-AUthenticate header to be
   passed to the credential helpers.

 * A new "fetch.hideRefs" option can be used to exclude specified refs
   from "rev-list --objects --stdin --not --all" traversal for
   checking object connectivity, most useful when there are many
   unrelated histories in a single repository.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Code clean-up to clarify directory traversal API.

 * Code clean-up to clarify the rule that "git-compat-util.h" must be
   the first to be included.

 * More work towards -Wunused.

 * Instead of forcing each command to choose to honor GPG related
   configuration variables, make the subsystem lazily initialize
   itself.


Fixes since v2.40
-----------------

 * "git fsck" learned to check the index files in other worktrees,
   just like "git gc" honors them as anchoring points.
   (merge 8d3e7eac52 jk/fsck-indices-in-worktrees later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
