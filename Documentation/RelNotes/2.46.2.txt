Git 2.46.2 Release Notes
========================

This release is primarily to merge changes to unbreak the 32-bit
GitHub actions jobs we use for CI testing, so that we can release
real fixes for the 2.46.x track after they pass CI.

It also reverts the "git patch-id" change that went into 2.46.1,
as it seems to have got a regression reported (I haven't verified,
but it is better to keep a known breakage than adding an unintended
regression).
