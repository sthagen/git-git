Git v2.51 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Userdiff patterns for the R language have been added.

 * Documentation for "git send-email" has been updated with a bit more
   credential helper and OAuth information.

 * "git cat-file --batch" learns to understand %(objectmode) atom to
   allow the caller to tell missing objects (due to repository
   corruption) and submodules (whose commit objects are OK to be
   missing) apart.

 * "git diff --no-index dirA dirB" can limit the comparison with
   pathspec at the end of the command line, just like normal "git
   diff".

 * "git subtree" (in contrib/) learned to grok GPG signing its commits.

 * "git whatchanged" that is longer to type than "git log --raw"
   which is its modern rough equivalent has outlived its usefulness
   more than 10 years ago.  Plan to deprecate and remove it.

 * An interchange format for stash entries is defined, and subcommand
   of "git stash" to import/export has been added.

 * "git merge/pull" has been taught the "--compact-summary" option to
   use the compact-summary format, intead of diffstat, when showing
   the summary of the incoming changes.

 * "git imap-send" has been broken for a long time, which has been
   resurrected and then taught to talk OAuth2.0 etc.

 * Some error messages from "git imap-send" has been updated.

 * When "git daemon" sees a signal while attempting to accept() a new
   client, instead of retrying, it skipped it by mistake, which has
   been corrected.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * "git pack-objects" learned to find delta bases from blobs at the
   same path, using the --path-walk API.

 * CodingGuidelines update.

 * Add settings for Solaris 10 & 11.

 * Meson-based build/test framework now understands TAP output
   generated by our tests.

 * "Do not explicitly initialize to zero" rule has been clarified in
   the CodingGuidelines document.

 * A test helper "test_seq" function learned the "-f <fmt>" option,
   which allowed us to simplify a lot of test scripts.

 * A lot of stale stuff has been removed from the contrib/ hierarchy.

 * "git push" and "git fetch" are taught to update refs in batches to
   gain performance.


Fixes since v2.50
-----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the changes in 2.50.X maintenance track,
including security updates, are included in this release.

 * A memory-leak in an error code path has been plugged.
   (merge 7082da85cb ly/commit-graph-graph-write-leakfix later to maint).

 * A memory-leak in an error code path has been plugged.
   (merge aedebdb6b9 ly/fetch-pack-leakfix later to maint).

 * Some leftover references to documentation source files that no
   longer exist, due to recent ".txt" -> ".adoc" renaming, have been
   corrected.
   (merge 3717a5775a jw/doc-txt-to-adoc-refs later to maint).

 * "git stash -p <pathspec>" improvements.
   (merge 468817bab2 pw/stash-p-pathspec-fixes later to maint).

 * "git send-email" incremented its internal message counter when a
   message was edited, which made logic that treats the first message
   specially misbehave, which has been corrected.
   (merge 2cc27b3501 ag/send-email-edit-threading-fix later to maint).

 * "git stash" recorded a wrong branch name when submodules are
   present in the current checkout, which has been corrected.
   (merge ffb36c64f2 kj/stash-onbranch-submodule-fix later to maint).

 * When asking to apply mailmap to both author and committer field
   while showing a commit object, the field that appears later was not
   correctly parsed and replaced, which has been corrected.
   (merge abf94a283f sa/multi-mailmap-fix later to maint).

 * "git maintenance" lacked the care "git gc" had to avoid holding
   onto the repository lock for too long during packing refs, which
   has been remedied.
   (merge 1b5074e614 ps/maintenance-ref-lock later to maint).

 * Avoid regexp_constraint and instead use comparison_constraint when
   listing functions to exclude from application of coccinelle rules,
   as spatch can be built with different regexp engine X-<.
   (merge f2ad545813 jc/cocci-avoid-regexp-constraint later to maint).

 * Updating submodules from the upstream did not work well when
   submodule's HEAD is detached, which has been improved.
   (merge ca62f524c1 jk/submodule-remote-lookup-cleanup later to maint).

 * Remove unnecessary check from "git daemon" code.
   (merge 0c856224d2 cb/daemon-fd-check-fix later to maint).
