Git v2.49 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Completion script updates for zsh


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * More -Wsign-compare fixes.

 * meson-based build now supports the unsafe-sha1 build knob.

 * The code to check LSan results has been simplified and made more
   robust.
   (merge 164a2516eb jk/lsan-race-ignore-false-positive later to maint).

 * More code paths have a repository passed through the callchain,
   instead of assuming the primary the_repository object.


Fixes since v2.48
-----------------

 * "git submodule" learned various ways to spell the same option,
   e.g. "--branch=B" can be spelled "--branch B" or "-bB".
   (merge b86f0f9071 re/submodule-parse-opt later to maint).

 * Tweak the help text used for the option value placeholders by
   parse-options API so that translations can customize the "<>"
   placeholder signal (e.g. "--option=<value>").
   (merge 5b34dd08d0 as/long-option-help-i18n later to maint).

 * CI jobs gave sporadic failures, which turns out that that the
   object finalization code was giving an error when it did not have
   to.
   (merge d7fcbe2c56 ps/object-collision-check later to maint).

 * The code to compute "unique" name used git_rand() which can fail or
   get stuck; the callsite does not require cryptographic security.
   Introduce the "insecure" mode and use it appropriately.
   (merge 0b4f8afef6 ps/reftable-get-random-fix later to maint).

 * A misconfigured "fsck.skiplist" configuration variable was not
   diagnosed as an error, which has been corrected.
   (merge ca7158076f jt/fsck-skiplist-parse-fix later to maint).

 * Extended SHA-1 expression parser did not work well when a branch
   with an unusual name (e.g. "foo{bar") is involved.
   (merge 191f0c8db2 en/object-name-with-funny-refname-fix later to maint).

 * The meson build procedure looked for the 'version-def.h' file in a
   wrong directory, which has been corrected.
   (merge 4771501c0a tc/meson-use-our-version-def-h later to maint).

 * The meson build procedure for Documentation/technical/ hierarchy was
   missing necessary dependencies, which has been corrected.
   (merge 1dca492edd sj/meson-doc-technical-dependency-fix later to maint).

 * The "instaweb" bound only to local IP address without "--local" and
   to all addresses with "--local", which was the other way around, when
   using Python's http.server class, which has been corrected.
   (merge 76baf97fa1 ak/instaweb-python-port-binding-fix later to maint).

 * Document that it is insecure to use Personal Access Tokens, which
   some hosting providers take as username/password, embedded in URLs.
   (merge a90ff409f0 mh/doc-credential-helpers-with-pat later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge ddb5287894 jk/t7407-use-test-grep later to maint).
   (merge 21e1b44865 aj/difftool-config-doc-fix later to maint).
   (merge 6a63995335 mh/gitattr-doc-markup-fix later to maint).
   (merge 43850dcf9c sk/unit-test-hash later to maint).
   (merge 4ad47d2de3 jc/cli-doc-option-and-config later to maint).
