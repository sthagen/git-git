Git 2.37.2 Release Notes
========================

This primarily is to backport various fixes accumulated on the 'master'
front since 2.37.1.

Fixes since v2.37.1
-------------------

 * "git shortlog -n" relied on the underlying qsort() to be stable,
   which shouldn't have.  Fixed.

 * Variable quoting fix in the vimdiff driver of "git mergetool".

 * An earlier attempt to plug leaks placed a clean-up label to jump to
   at a bogus place, which as been corrected.

 * Fixes a long-standing corner case bug around directory renames in
   the merge-ort strategy.

 * Recent update to vimdiff layout code has been made more robust
   against different end-user vim settings.

 * In a non-bare repository, the behavior of Git when the
   core.worktree configuration variable points at a directory that has
   a repository as its subdirectory, regressed in Git 2.27 days.

 * References to commands-to-be-typed-literally in "git rebase"
   documentation mark-up have been corrected.

 * Give _() markings to fatal/warning/usage: labels that are shown in
   front of these messages.

 * "git mktree --missing" lazily fetched objects that are missing from
   the local object store, which was totally unnecessary for the purpose
   of creating the tree object(s) from its input.

 * Fixes for tests when the source directory has unusual characters in
   its path, e.g. whitespaces, double-quotes, etc.

 * Adjust technical/bitmap-format to be formatted by AsciiDoc, and
   add some missing information to the documentation.

 * Certain diff options are currently ignored when combined-diff is
   shown; mark them as incompatible with the feature.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
