Git v2.37 Release Notes
=======================

Fixes since v2.36
-----------------

 * "git submodule update" without pathspec should silently skip an
   uninitialized submodule, but it started to become noisy by mistake.
   (merge 4f1ccef87c gc/submodule-update-part2 later to maint).

 * "diff-tree --stdin" has been broken for about a year, but 2.36
   release broke it even worse by breaking running the command with
   <pathspec>, which in turn broke "gitk" and got noticed.  This has
   been corrected by aligning its behaviour to that of "log".
   (merge f8781bfda3 jc/diff-tree-stdin-fix later to maint).

 * Regression fix for 2.36 where "git name-rev" started to sometimes
   reference strings after they are freed.
   (merge 45a14f578e rs/name-rev-fix-free-after-use later to maint).
