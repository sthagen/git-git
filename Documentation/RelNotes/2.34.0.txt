Git 2.34 Release Notes
======================

Updates since Git 2.33
----------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Pathname expansion (like "~username/") learned a way to specify a
   location relative to Git installation (e.g. its $sharedir which is
   $(prefix)/share), with "%(prefix)".

 * Use `ort` instead of `recursive` as the default merge strategy.

 * The userdiff pattern for "java" language has been updated.

 * "git rebase" by default skips changes that are equivalent to
   commits that are already in the history the branch is rebased onto;
   give messages when this happens to let the users be aware of
   skipped commits, and also teach them how to tell "rebase" to keep
   duplicated changes.

 * The advice message that "git cherry-pick" gives when it asks
   conflicted replay of a commit to be resolved by the end user has
   been updated.

 * After "git clone --recurse-submodules", all submodules are cloned
   but they are not by default recursed into by other commands.  With
   submodule.stickyRecursiveClone configuration set, submodule.recurse
   configuration is set to true in a repository created by "clone"
   with "--recurse-submodules" option.

 * The logic for auto-correction of misspelt subcommands learned to go
   interactive when the help.autocorrect configuration variable is set
   to 'prompt'.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git bisect" spawned "git show-branch" only to pretty-print the
   title of the commit after checking out the next version to be
   tested; this has been rewritten in C.

 * "git add" can work better with the sparse index.

 * Support for ancient versions of cURL library (pre 7.19.4) has been
   dropped.

 * A handful of tests that assumed implementation details of files
   backend for refs have been cleaned up.

 * trace2 logs learned to show parent process name to see in what
   context Git was invoked.

 * Loading of ref tips to prepare for common ancestry negotiation in
   "git fetch-pack" has been optimized by taking advantage of the
   commit graph when available.

 * Remind developers that the userdiff patterns should be kept simple
   and permissive, assuming that the contents they apply are always
   syntactically correct.

 * The current implementation of GIT_TEST_FAIL_PREREQS is broken in
   that checking for the lack of a prerequisite would not work.  Avoid
   the use of "if ! test_have_prereq X" in a test script.

 * The revision traversal API has been optimized by taking advantage
   of the commit-graph, when available, to determine if a commit is
   reachable from any of the existing refs.

 * "git fetch --quiet" optimization to avoid useless computation of
   info that will never be displayed.

 * Callers from older advice_config[] based API has been updated to
   use the newer advice_if_enabled() and advice_enabled() API.


Fixes since v2.33
-----------------

 * Input validation of "git pack-objects --stdin-packs" has been
   corrected.
   (merge 561fa03529 ab/pack-stdin-packs-fix later to maint).

 * Bugfix for common ancestor negotiation recently introduced in "git
   push" code path.
   (merge 82823118b9 jt/push-negotiation-fixes later to maint).

 * "git pull" had various corner cases that were not well thought out
   around its --rebase backend, e.g. "git pull --ff-only" did not stop
   but went ahead and rebased when the history on other side is not a
   descendant of our history.  The series tries to fix them up.
   (merge 6f843a3355 en/pull-conflicting-options later to maint).

 * "git apply" miscounted the bytes and failed to read to the end of
   binary hunks.
   (merge 46d723ce57 jk/apply-binary-hunk-parsing-fix later to maint).

 * "git range-diff" code clean-up.
   (merge c4d5907324 jk/range-diff-fixes later to maint).

 * "git commit --fixup" now works with "--edit" again, after it was
   broken in v2.32.
   (merge 8ef6aad664 jk/commit-edit-fixup-fix later to maint).

 * Use upload-artifacts v1 (instead of v2) for 32-bit linux, as the
   new version has a blocker bug for that architecture.
   (merge 3cf9bb36bf cb/ci-use-upload-artifacts-v1 later to maint).

 * Checking out all the paths from HEAD during the last conflicted
   step in "git rebase" and continuing would cause the step to be
   skipped (which is expected), but leaves MERGE_MSG file behind in
   $GIT_DIR and confuses the next "git commit", which has been
   corrected.
   (merge e5ee33e855 pw/rebase-skip-final-fix later to maint).

 * Various bugs in "git rebase -r" have been fixed.
   (merge f2563c9ef3 pw/rebase-r-fixes later to maint).

 * mmap() imitation used to call xmalloc() that dies upon malloc()
   failure, which has been corrected to just return an error to the
   caller to be handled.
   (merge 95b4ff3931 rs/git-mmap-uses-malloc later to maint).

 * "git diff --relative" segfaulted and/or produced incorrect result
   when there are unmerged paths.
   (merge 8174627b3d dd/diff-files-unmerged-fix later to maint).

 * The delayed checkout code path in "git checkout" etc. were chatty
   even when --quiet and/or --no-progress options were given.
   (merge 7a132c628e mt/quiet-with-delayed-checkout later to maint).

 * "git branch -D <branch>" used to refuse to remove a broken branch
   ref that points at a missing commit, which has been corrected.
   (merge 597a977489 rs/branch-allow-deleting-dangling later to maint).

 * Build update for Apple clang.
   (merge f32c5d3716 cb/makefile-apple-clang later to maint).

 * The parser for the "--nl" option of "git column" has been
   corrected.
   (merge c93ca46cf5 sg/column-nl later to maint).

 * "git upload-pack" which runs on the other side of "git fetch"
   forgot to take the ref namespaces into account when handling
   want-ref requests.
   (merge 53a66ec37c ka/want-ref-in-namespace later to maint).

 * The sparse-index support can corrupt the index structure by storing
   a stale and/or uninitialized data, which has been corrected.
   (merge d9e9b44d7a jh/sparse-index-resize-fix later to maint).

 * Buggy tests could damage repositories outside the throw-away test
   area we created.  We now by default export GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
   to limit the damage from such a stray test.
   (merge 614c3d8f2e sg/set-ceiling-during-tests later to maint).

 * Even when running "git send-email" without its own threaded
   discussion support, a threading related header in one message is
   carried over to the subsequent message to result in an unwanted
   threading, which has been corrected.
   (merge e082113484 mh/send-email-reset-in-reply-to later to maint).

 * The output from "git fast-export", when its anonymization feature
   is in use, showed an annotated tag incorrectly.
   (merge 2f040a9671 tk/fast-export-anonymized-tag-fix later to maint).

 * Doc update plus improved error reporting.
   (merge 1e93770888 jk/log-warn-on-bogus-encoding later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 1d9c8daef8 ab/bundle-doc later to maint).
   (merge 81483fe613 en/merge-strategy-docs later to maint).
   (merge 626beebdf8 js/log-protocol-version later to maint).
